# Tic-tac-toe-game
This is the implementation of the popular TIC-TAC-TOE Game created using the Ruby programming Language

The first milestone is to create the necessary files and folders and make the file executable

Tic Tac Toe - Ruby OOP
Game Rules
- Each player is going to choose a number out of 9 positions.
- First player should enter his name and press enter.
- Second player should enter his name and press enter.
- First player should enter his symbol [X or O] and press enter.
- To choose a position you have to type the corresponding number and press enter.
- The game will check if the chosen number is valid or not valid.
- If it's not valid (i.e already taken number or not of the game positions - from 1 to 9 ) it will ask for another input.
- If it's valid it will display the board with the chosen position replaced by the symbol of the player [X, O].
- Then it will ask the next player to take turn.
- It will repeate the same for the second player.
- The game contiues till it reaches either winning or draw conditions.

Winning conditions
We have 8 winning conditions...

- First three, to have occupied a full row with the same symbol [X, O]
- Second three, to have occupied a column with same symbol [X, O]
- Third two, to have occupied a full diagonal with same symbol [X, O]

Draw condition
- If 9 movements achieved with no winning then the game is a draw.


Built With:

- Ruby
- VS Code
- Ubuntu
- Rubocop linter

## Getting Started

To get your own copy of our project simply clone the repository to your local machine.

Step 1: Type the following command into a git shell

git clone https://github.com/charlyeneh/tic-tac-toe-game

Step 2: Direct a terminal into the cloned repository directory

cd tic-tac-toe-game

Step 3: Run the program from command line

Step 4: Run main.rb from your terminal to display "Hello World!".



# Testing Tic-tac-toe with RSpec 

> In this project we incoperated some testing using RSpec at the end of the tic-tac-toe game

![screenshot](images/testing.png)

## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started
- Open CMD
- Git clone https://github.com/charlyeneh/tic-tac-toe-game-
- Make sure Ruby is installed on your computer

## Testing with Rspec

This project is tested with Rspec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language

## How to get Rspec Running

- Run the following command in the terminal
  ```
  gem install rspec
  ```
- This command installs Rspec on your computer. You ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following     command to see the installed version
  ```
  rspec --version
  ```
- You should get output similar to the following:
  ```
  RSpec 3.10
    - rspec-core 3.10.1
    - rspec-expectations 3.10.1
    - rspec-mocks 3.10.2
    - rspec-support 3.10.2
  ```
  The rspec gem comes packed with all we need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.

- Navigagte into the AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables folder
  ```
  cd AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables
  ```
- Run the following command to initialize Rspec
  ```
  rspec --init
  ```
- This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project

- Finally, to run the tests, simple run:
  ```
  rspec
  ```
