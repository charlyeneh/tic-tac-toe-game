# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the implementation of the popular TIC-TAC-TOE Game created using the Ruby programming Language

Game Rules
* Each player is going to choose a number out of 9 positions.
* First player should enter his name and press enter.
* Second player should enter his name and press enter.
* First player should enter his symbol [X or O] and press enter.
* To choose a position you have to type the corresponding number and press enter.
* The game will check if the chosen number is valid or not valid.
* If it's not valid (i.e already taken number or not of the game positions - from 1 to 9 ) it will ask for another input.
* If it's valid it will display the board with the chosen position replaced by the symbol of the player [X, O].
* Then it will ask the next player to take turn.
* It will repeate the same for the second player.
* The game contiues till it reaches either a winning or a draw condition.

Winning conditions
We have 8 winning conditions...

* First three, to have occupied a full row with the same symbol [X, O]
* Second three, to have occupied a column with same symbol [X, O]
* Last two, to have occupied a full diagonal with same symbol [X, O]

Draw condition
* If 9 movements made with no winner then the game is a draw.


## Built With:

* Ruby
* RSpec

* `cd` into the `Tic-Tac-Toe` folder
* Run `ruby main.rb`
* Run the program from command line following the prompts it supplies


## Testing with RSpec 

This project is tested with RSpec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language.

### How to get Rspec Running 

* Run the following command in the terminal `gem install rspec` This command installs Rspec on your computer.
* Ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following command to see the installed version `rspec --version`
* You should get output similar to the following:
  ```
  RSpec 3.10
    - rspec-core 3.10.1
    - rspec-expectations 3.10.1
    - rspec-mocks 3.10.2
    - rspec-support 3.10.2
  ```
* The rspec gem comes packed with all we need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.
* Run the following command to initialize RSpec `rspec --init` This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project
* Finally, to run the tests, simply run `rspec`
